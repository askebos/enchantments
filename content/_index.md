Weâ€™re a network of scholars who seek to develop enchantment as an organizing theme in historical studies of capitalism. We hope to provide a platform for those interested in the historical role of enchantment as a tool, structure, or foundation for the organisation and the development of modern markets, economic institutions, and economic relationships.

This summer and fall, we have been talking to scholars of enchantment about their work; check out our new [podcast](resources) section! Our roundtable discussions are also still available as [memos](resources), and consider contributing to our open [Zotero folder](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4634111/economic_enchantments).
