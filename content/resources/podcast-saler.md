### Transcript

##### 00:00:01 Kristof

Welcome, dear listeners, to the podcast of Enchantment in the History of
Capitalism. We are a young research network that aims to conceptualize
enchantment, I suppose to better understand the history of capitalism,
either as a tool, or as a structure, or as a founding principle of
economic markets or institutions or relationships. And with 'we' I
mostly mean Anat Rosenberg Astrid Van den Bossche, the two initiators of
the network who in the spring started with a series of roundtables in
which we got scholars together to talk about enchantment and how we can
think about enchantment in terms of capitalism.

And now, over the summer, we're talking to scholars who have engaged
with enchantment in their work and who have also developed important
working definitions of what enchantment is. And it's therefore, I
think, entirely self-evident to introduce you to Michael Saler, our
guest of today, who's a professor of History at the University of
California, Davis, and he teaches European cultural and intellectual
history. And those who look or will look or have already looked at the
[bibliography on our website](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4634111/economic_enchantments) may have seen that Michael has contributed
quite significantly to the bibliography, and also to the historiography,
and in many ways actually steered -- helped steer -- that historiography
of enchantment. And it's actually, I noticed, the ten-year anniversary
of Michael's book [*As If: Modern Enchantment and the Literary Prehistory
of Virtual Reality*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/as-if-9780195343168?cc=us&lang=en&), which I can only recommend, also by means of
introduction. Congratulations on the anniversary, Michael.

##### 00:01:37 Michael

Thank you.

##### 00:01:39 Kristof

Thank you very much for wanting to do this. Perhaps as a first
introductory question: What is it that continues to draw you to
enchantment as a concept with which to study modernity, I suppose?

##### 00:01:54 Michael

Huh, interesting, very interesting question. Well, I think enchantment
has always been very important to me, simply in terms of my own
investment in the imagination, whether it be literature or art or
imaginary worlds in general. It's something that has just been part of
my life. And I'm a modern person, and so as I was growing up and
becoming a little more cognitively aware, to be told that the world was
disenchanted was always a puzzle to me. And I think in some ways that's
what also continues to draw me to this question of enchantment and
disenchantment.

Uhm, these are very ambiguous terms, confusing terms. It's very easy to
kind of get lost in various definitions and feel like you're spinning
your wheels. But the broader issue of enchantment and disenchantment
seems so key to definitions of certainly Western modernity, and maybe
more so now global modernity, since we're in a truly global age now.
But certainly since the 18th century the idea that the West was
disenchanted, it's not the 17th century since the scientific revolution
has been a prevalent paradigm. And I guess I was curious about why that
was so, because it didn't seem to me to be true, not in terms of my own
life experience and not in terms of my peers come and looking into it.

I found it to be a very interesting historical discourse. It was
revelatory of other issues of modernity, and in a sense it's an ingress
into maybe how we can think about modernity and even perhaps
postmodernity, you know, it's just one of those kind of tools that we
can use maybe to ask broader questions. So I still think it's an
important discourse to look at. It certainly had very important effects
and it opens many interesting questions. So that's how I would answer
that question, yes.

##### 00:04:00 Kristof

I think it's a very good answer, actually, that opens up a lot of new
questions indeed. I guess one of which is linked to some of the
questions that the network asks as well. Do you see it and I think
you've partly answered it already, but maybe you can say a little more
about: Is there a chronology of enchantment and disenchantment or the
dynamic between the two, in your eyes?

##### 00:04:25 Michael

I do think there is. I do think that if you look for the historical
origins of this discourse, you do find it, particularly among our early
romantic poets in Germany. Of course, Weber drew on one in particular in
the late 18th century, and then, you know, popular discourses about the
world in the 19th century, which did discuss the term disenchantment.
It's something you can go on to Google Ngram and actually find peaks
and valleys, and certainly there are more peaks.

So historically, I think the issue of modern disenchantment in the West
is one that really arose primarily in the late 18th century and just
continued. And then of course was given canonical formation, I suppose,
or formulation by Max Weber in his 1917 lecture and then previously, you
know, in *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism* we talked
about rationalization and disenchantment as being kind of key to Western
modernity, the dominant problem and what's interesting there, I think,
in terms of this chronology, is that of course he was a sociologist and
he was taken up by other sociologists, translated into English by
Talcott Parsons, who actually gave us the term disenchantment, that was
not Weber's term. Weber's term was 'Entzauberung': the removal of magic
from the world, and he had a very specific idea about magic. Magic was
rational for him, for example, but Talcott Parsons' term Is really a
kind of brilliant term, I think, because it also included an affective
dimension that was not in 'Entzauberung', and that is the kind of melee
that we feel in modernity, I think by living in a kind of bureaucratic,
rational world where we have to follow certain procedures, it seemed
completely irrational to us and not addressing our own inner needs.
Spiritual, emotional, aesthetic, existential needs. And that's very
much I do think a part of Western modernity.

I think Weber was right in so many respects, and subsequent
sociologists, and I include among those Max Weber and Horkheimer,
Adorno, you know, Marcuse, of course, with the New Left, Foucault, who
was not a sociologist but, I mean, continued the Weberian discourse. And
you can take it right through Charles Taylor with *A Secular Age*, a
philosopher who once again repeats this same discourse. So it's become,
at least within academia, broader than sociology, within cultural
studies everywhere, history, it's become, it became a prominent,
prominent paradigm. In fact, let's go further than that. Let's just
say that the Western, the most prominent definition of Western modernity
has really been Weber's idea, both rationalization and disenchantment.
Reason is at the heart of Western modernity, and that's replicated
again by all those figures that I talked about and that disenchantment,
that sense of affective malaise, oppression, is also very much a part of
that paradigm.

And it's the wrong paradigm. That's the interesting thing. Although to
be fair, I mean we only can say this because we have the advantage of
hindsight, historical hindsight. I mean, I think Weber when he was
postulating his theories in *The Protestant Ethic* was on to something
absolutely true, particularly for his own time. It's just that in the
course of the 20th century, I think we began to see other processes
within Western modernity that he had kind of marginalized take on a
greater and greater hold in the world, rendering that paradigm that he
has given us, less useful than it was at the time. I'm particularly
thinking about the role of imagination. Which, like a good Victorian,
like so many of them, it goes back to classical antiquity. The
imagination was always subordinate to reason in the West, and this just
perpetuated that very, not just Western, but very Protestant suspicion
of desire, and imagining things that aren't there, or maybe being the
victims of the delusive enchantments of papists, etc.

But, you know, the imagination continued to be a problem right through,
you know, the late 19th century for many. But it was at the late 19th
century, really the mid to late 19th century, that the imagination as,
you know, Bratton later said in the 1920s began to assert its rights.
And so, so really, I think Weber was talking about a true but true
first-time paradigm that does not hold water, did not hold water from
the late 19th century and particularly the present where I would argue
in fact, that reason is not the problem right now. Reason is the
necessary solution. I think fantasy, the imagination, may be the problem
to some extent.

What I would like to see is more of a balance between the two and I
think actually that might be one of the most important dynamics of
Western modernity in retrospect that we can see. And that is, it wasn't
just the Enlightenment that is the defining feature. Enlightenment
reason, instrumental reason, is the defining feature of Western
modernity. It's the Enlightenment and romanticism -- any attempt. Two
of both those so-called camps, each of which actually acknowledged the
other. I mean the Romantics valued reason, many of them, and science,
enlightenment thinkers, Hume and Kant and Smith: they valued the
imagination.

You know, it was not binary, but I think that the real issue that we see
in very interesting ways, particularly from the late 19th century
through the present, is the attempt to bring reason and the imagination
together in some sort of productive synthesis.

##### 00:10:21 Kristof

That's yeah, yeah. I think that's something that this network is also
working towards, to seeing that dynamic as the driving force in a way of
changing how people think their way through their own modernity. And
it's like you say, you link it very strongly in your work as well to
literary and artistic imagination and maybe also to the way that the
output of that imagination is consumed by a growing, yes, well, cultural
consumption, I guess. A mass consumption. Perhaps you could say
something a little more about the reception side of this idea of the
enchanted imagination?

##### 00:11:04 Michael

Yeah, it's a really interesting question. I think I was... I wrote a
book about it actually, the book you mentioned and I was overly
optimistic. I myself came of age in the 1990s, when the great -- I was a
techno utopian. I mean, you know, the utopian. Getting onto the Internet
was like getting into heaven for me in the 1990s. And I just thought,
this is marvelous and so many people did, right. This is going to change
everything. Knowledge is going to be available, we'll be global, we'll
be connected. We'll be able to have rational exchanges with one another
in these public spheres, To the imagination. You know it, it will all
work out, Habermas was right? And this is going to be the fulfillment of
it to some degree or other. And that's not how it turned out at all. So
in that 2012 book, I still think that bore traces of a kind of more
hopeful and optimistic side.

You know, and I do think that was right at the time that, you know,
social media had just begun to take over and we began to see them align
very bad influences of these platforms and you know, Internet culture in
general and what it can do in terms of this sort of enchantment in a
negative sense, you know, the perpetuation of delusive enchantment.
Which is really an interesting question now. I mean, that's really what
we're having to deal with, trying to find tools to work around and
address. I am reminded, though, of course, that you know all of this is
very recent and we shouldn't be too impatient. I mean, we need to be
impatient, actually, we need it. Things are moving very quickly, so we
do need to be impatient and actually try to forestall what's going on.
Dictatorships are rising and returning everywhere and lots of other
things, global warming, etc. But nevertheless, I mean, let's not beat
ourselves up for not being able to address these as quickly as we need
to, too, because we're just dealing with something that's a totally
new kind of dominant, cultural dominant.

But anyway, I'm kind of digressing here. You asked me about reception
and so I can't -- I don't have an answer really, except that I'm
seeing a lot, as we all are, a lot of negatives to the promulgation of
the imagination, fantasy, desire, of course. And you know, obviously the
Internet, social media provides tools for us to have unimaginable
information at our fingertips to disseminate and conversations that we
do have and I think we've had a lot of positives from that as well, not
to downgrade and denigrate that side of it as well. But really, how to
bring the imagination and the desire that comes with it together with
the rational skeptical critical component, is really one of the, for me
at least, that conundrum.

##### 00:14:03 Kristof

That's a very similar dynamic to what you were describing earlier in
many ways. The one between, well, ratio between quotation marks and the
imagination on one hand, and what you call the delight and the delusion
on the other.

##### 00:14:16 Michael

Yeah, yeah, yeah, that still is there. Right.

##### 00:14:19 Kristof

They're intertwined in a way that we can't really pull apart.

##### 00:14:22 Michael

That's right. That's right. They are, they are and they have been
historically inextricable. That's absolutely right. They have been. And
you know, and I, I think there's some common-sense tools that that we
have, you know, basic education in terms of critical thinking and
compassion, you know, being more tolerant. I mean, you know, all sorts
of shibboleths that we can kind of throw out, but for whatever reason it
seems like they don't stick. All of that again be an artifact of false
vision that we get from the kind of strident voices that we're exposed
to on the Internet. We have to always remember that we're only getting
a part, not the whole, when we, you know, turn on Twitter and we're
just assaulted and we assume that's the world, but it may not be. I
hope it isn't, but.

Uh, anyway, anyway, to me that is another reason why this discourse of
enchantment and disenchantment remains alive. For all the ambiguities of
these terms, they still are playing out in in real life. So and you
know. As you know, right, and in your whole research network, Jane
Bennett and you know how enchantment -- these terms have practical pay
offs, not just negative or positive. And so we're all interested in
kind of figuring out capitalism, how does this work? How, how can we use
these ideas that we've inherited historically and to better the world,
I suppose. And again, I guess if I can just end this diatribe on a final
note, I suppose for me, I'm a historian and I really do think that's
where we can find answers both to the question of what is enchantment?
What is disenchantment? There are multiple definitions, as you know, and
they're there in history, too. What were the dynamics going on that
engendered these debates and discussions? What were the answers, what
were the countervailing, you know, views? How did this develop? How did
it get settled? Where do we go from here? And I really do think that,
you know, continued research historically is a way to answer some of
these questions about what this is. What do these terms mean? How can we
usefully discuss them? Otherwise we do... There is that danger, of
course, defining one set of ambiguous terms by several sets of other
ambiguous terms.

##### 00:16:53 Kristof

I think in a way you've given a very good answer to the question that I
had written down which I didn't get around to asking, which is whether
enchantment is best understood as something that is continued throughout
history or if it's something that's historically contingent or
specific to a specific context, because it's both in a way. It's a
very useful tool to look at very long term process. This is, while being
able to pick up the specific context or the specific dynamics at a given
moment at a given place.

##### 00:17:23 Michael

Yes, that's right, yes.

##### 00:17:25 Kristof

And that's very helpful for us actually, yes.

##### 00:17:30 Michael

We speak to the choir here. But yes, no, I agree with you. I totally
agree with, you know philosophy begins in wonder and that goes back, of
course to Plato and wonder is connected to enchantment. I think we could
say that. And so these remain important terms worthy of continued work
for specifically that reason, but I just am reminded of a famous
historian of science whose name I will not mention, came to our campus.
And at one point, I mean, she had, in her own work, touched on
enchantment, disenchantment. But she was, at that point, thoroughly
disenchanted with these terms and she really did talk about the wheel
spinning and I certainly am sympathetic to that, but from my own
perspective I think it's still worth continuing to investigate and
explore, for all the frustrations.

And, you know, it's probably not much different than exploring
something like romanticism, which has, you know, hundreds of definitions
or for that matter, a term like the Gothic, right. I mean, in some ways,
to historians, I suppose it seems very puzzling that we still talk about
the Gothic mode of literature, and we subsume so many different
expressions into the Gothic. And yet, historians wanted to say, wait a
minute, the Gothic arose in the late 18th century in in response to
certain questions and issues and discourses, and then the world has
changed drastically. So to say that *Dracula* is a Gothic novel seems
counter intuitive when it was also addressing so many other things that
couldn't possibly have been considered in the 18th century. And then
why are we talking about, you know, *Game of Thrones* is the modern
Gothic simply because it's romantic medieval in some ways, but you
know. So I'm all... This is by way of saying if you... This is the part
and parcel of the Academy, anyway. Just what we do.

##### 00:19:30 Kristof

Yeah, which means this is a very good point to end the conversation as
well for now or end the recording at least. And thank you very much for
joining in the discussion. We'll also put like, well, I'll stop the
recording here if that's OK.

##### 00:19:44 Michael

Well, thank you. Yes, I appreciate having a chance to talk with you.
