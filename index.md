# Enchantments in the History of Capitalism

We're a network of scholars who seek to develop enchantment as an organizing theme in historical studies of capitalism. We hope to provide a platform for those interested in the historical role of enchantment as a tool, structure, or foundation for the organisation and the development of modern markets, economic institutions, and economic relationships. We focus primarily on the United Kingdom but also welcome comparative and wider transnational perspectives. 

Everyone is welcome.

## Events
At the moment, our activities are focused on running a series of roundtables to converge discussion around a set of leading texts that represent existing conceptual and historical scholarship on enchantment in modernity, from the fields of theology, anthropology, the history of science, literature and art, philosophy, marketing and business.

Our invited expert speakers set the key readings that are discussed at the roundtable. Meeting notes will be uploaded within two weeks of the event.
