<p>How should we understand the role of enchantment in the history of capitalism?</p>
<p>In recent decades, the human and social sciences have turned to enchantment in its broadest conceptions as a paradigm to better understand present-day market dynamics. They have shown that enchantment functions as a tool and structuring force in diverse aspects of contemporary economic life, be they magical thinking in advertising, astrology on the stock market, occult finance, the quasi-religious celebration of excess or the magical service economy. This vibrant scholarship draws on a critical lineage of thinkers in late capitalism, from Marx to Latour, which has revealed the modern capitalist economy as thriving on non-rational forces, drives, and modes of thinking.</p>
<p>Rather than ask if capitalism is enchanted, then, the question becomes ‘How is capitalism enchanted?’ To answer this question requires an historical approach. Despite influential historically-oriented scholarship, for example Colin Campbell’s <em>The Romantic Ethic and the Spirit of Modern Consumerism</em> (1987) or recently Eugene McCarraher’s <em>The Enchantments of Mammon</em> (2019), histories have yet to examine the role of enchantment in the development of economic structures, relationships, ideas, businesses and markets on a systematic level.</p>
<p>This conference, organised by the ‘Enchantment in the History of Capitalism’ network, aims to provide a first major intervention in this nascent field, and to set a research agenda for studying enchantment(s) in the history of capitalism. More information about the network, as well as previous research initiatives and a working bibliography, can be found at <a href="economic-enchantments.net/">economic-enchantments.net</a>.</p>
<p>The conference will open with a reception and keynote address on June 29, and continue with work-in-progress discussions on June 30.</p>
<p>We invite proposals for papers on all aspects of enchanted capitalist histories by established as well as early career researchers. Please submit a short abstract (c.350 words) and bio (c.100 words) though the form below by <strong>28 February 2023</strong>. Limited support for travel may be allocated to early career researchers, please indicate if required with your submission.</p>
<p>Please note that accepted presenters will be expected to circulate short versions (3-8 pages) of their papers three weeks in advance.</p>
