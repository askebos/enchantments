      <description>At the moment, our activities are focused on running a series of roundtables to converge discussion around a set of leading texts that represent existing conceptual and historical scholarship on enchantment in modernity, from the fields of theology, anthropology, the history of science, literature and art, philosophy, marketing and business.
The goal is to map existing knowledge as well as draw out theoretical points of contention through joint readings and discussion of a set of questions relevant for the history of capitalism.</description>
