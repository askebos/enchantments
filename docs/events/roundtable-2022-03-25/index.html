<div class = "readable">
<p>Bruno Latour writes of catastrophes as opportunities for an enchanted
relationship. In that light, the stock market crash of 2008 and the
subsequent economic crisis functioned as a moment of enchantment. Seeing something as broken &lsquo;frees it up&rsquo;: it can be a
realisation that prompts redesign and reinterpretation, as well as
(re-)enchantment. This observation works both for analyses of global, and in
this case economic, structures as well as for analyses of individual material objects. In this roundtable, our
speakers David Morgan and Carrie Tirado Bramen explored the dynamics of crisis and redesign from different but intertwined
perspectives.</p>
<p><em>(1) What constitutes enchantment?</em> and <em>(5) Is materiality fundamental to enchantment?</em></p>
<p>The <a href="../roundtable-2022-02-24">previous roundtable</a> tested the concept of enchantment in both
theoretical and practical ways in histories of religion and magic. This
roundtable deepened our historical understanding of the concept, but
also broadened it by honing in on its materiality, and on its
commodification in one segment of the &lsquo;magical marketplace&rsquo;: astrology.
Morgan used his work on <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190272111.001.0001/oso-9780190272111">the material culture of
enchantment</a>
as a starting point to offer a working definition of enchantment as a
broader canopy under which religious phenomena coexist with other
processes of engagement with the things around us, from tarot cards and
animal entrails, to more quotidian, seemingly ordinary objects in
secular life.</p>
<p>Drawing on actor-network theory and the agency of matter to assert
power, Morgan proposes Enchantment Network Theory in which a human agent
engages with an object to exert influence on agencies connected with it.
Enchantment is not a psychological projection, but an action.
These are the small things we do, distributing agency to make the world
go our way. The canopy of enchantment stretches out far and wide &ndash; one
question afterwards was: &lsquo;What is <em>not</em> enchantment?&rsquo; &ndash; but it allows
us to conceptualize an &rsquo;enchantment as practised&rsquo; or a &rsquo;lived
enchantment&rsquo;, to study it as a set of practices and things, or
assemblages, in everyday life. This definition chimes well with, for
instance, the way Nicholas Campion proposes to study astrology by its
&lsquo;inner language&rsquo;, as a set of &lsquo;claims and practices [that] were lived
and experienced&rsquo;.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This approach can also help ground Jason Josephson Storm&rsquo;s genealogy of
enchantment set out in the <a href="../roundtable-2022-02-24">previous roundtable</a>,
which draws critical attention to what people in different places at
particular times included and excluded from their own understandings of
enchantment &ndash; and why. Bramen, who is currently working on a cultural
history of astrology, points out how people in past and present have
problematized modes of enchantment when it intersected with materiality
and pecuniary motives. &lsquo;Enchantment&rsquo; often holds a normative and
moralistic meaning in relation to capitalism and consumerism; a &rsquo;true&rsquo;
or &lsquo;utopian&rsquo; enchantment is pitted against a &lsquo;false&rsquo; one. Bramen gives
the example of Eugene McCarraher&rsquo;s <em>The enchantments of Mammon</em>, which
builds on romanticist views of enchantment, from William Blake&rsquo;s &lsquo;heaven
in a wildflower&rsquo; to W. H. Auden&rsquo;s &lsquo;desire nothing for ourselves&rsquo;, as
transcending pecuniary and possessive modes of enchantment.</p>
<p><em>(2) Is enchantment theorized as a structural or individual phenomenon?</em> and <em>(4) Is enchantment conceptualized as manipulation or as a form of agency?</em></p>
<p>In that regard, Bramen argues, astrology offers an especially productive
lens to look at capitalism as a &rsquo;totalizing or systemic concept&rsquo; because
it serves as a practice of cognitive mapping, also of &lsquo;how an individual
imagines their relation&hellip; to the social and economic organization of
global capitalism&rsquo;. In other words, astrology and &lsquo;mystical services&rsquo;
more generally are ways for individuals to relate to, cope with, and
position themselves within &ndash; or outside, in opposition to, and
alternate to &ndash; economic structures.</p>
<p>Morgan suggests, as he has done in his chapter on enchantment and
disenchantment, thinking of the materiality of enchantment in terms of
ecologies and webs of relations, in which individuals and their &rsquo;economy
of gestures&rsquo;, but especially objects and images function as nodes in the
Enchantment Network.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Central to this understanding of networked,
relational enchantment is the idea of asymmetrical exchange, which
Morgan explains as the difference between the small prosaic things
people do and the (hoped-for) disproportionally favourable result. It
transforms one thing into another, and as such enchantment can only be
understood in relational terms; it becomes visible as &rsquo;the whole&rsquo; rather
than &lsquo;its parts&rsquo;, to paraphrase Marcel Mauss&rsquo; famous study of magic.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Or perhaps more precisely, enchantment is what happens when several
factors connect and converge on a node of the network and transform it
into what Morgan calls a focal object: &lsquo;an interfacial node or material
form of interface with an entire network that it appears to replace in
order to make negotiation with it possible and corporeal&rsquo;.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
Enchantment is something that is <em>done</em>, in practices and through
labour.</p>
<p>Through an analysis of the hugely popular astrology app <a href="https://www.costarastrology.com/">Co-Star</a>, Bramen
invites us to think critically about issues of individual agency,
community, and manipulation as entangled. Two themes in particular are
of use to situate enchantment within histories of capitalism. First, and
leading once more to Max Weber, Bramen&rsquo;s arguments draw attention to the
power and charisma of stand-out individuals.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> They can be &lsquo;prophets
of profit&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> such as venture capitalists, billionaire entrepreneurs and
star traders, as well as <em>star</em> traders such as Banu Guler, Co-Star&rsquo;s
CEO. Second, we can learn much if we turn to the emotions and intuitions
of enchantment. Bramen mentions hope, pleasure, and frustration as
reasons people turn to astrology, and references <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo27949426.html">Emily Ogden&rsquo;s work on
mesmerism</a>
to warn against an all too optimistic view: cynicism and despair make
equally if not more powerful motivators. These emotions centre around
individual and shared risks, crises, fluctuations, misfortunes. Bramen
compares modern astrology to self-therapy: it foregrounds individual
growth and self-realization, often through consumption. Strikingly, it
no longer shows the emotional labour and assurance that astrology
displayed in the mid twentieth-century context of state-managed
capitalism, but rather mirrors customers&rsquo; <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo125281793.html">&lsquo;uncertainty in a
financialized
world&rsquo;</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p><em>(3) Is enchantment described as a continuous phenomenon, a new phenomenon, or as historically-specific constellations?</em></p>
<p>Both Morgan and Bramen provide a profoundly historicized reading of
enchantment in relation to capitalism, perhaps most obviously in terms
of technology. As Owen Davies discussed in the first roundtable,
practices of enchantment and magic are intrinsically caught up with
technological developments, and in fact often crucially depend on them.
Contesting older classifications of the modern imagination in which
&rsquo;technology is nothing but pure instrumental mastery&rsquo;, technology is
time and again shown to blur the boundaries between magic and
rationality, and to be capable of enchantment, whether we are talking
about the printing press, photography, the internet, or NFTs.</p>
<p>But the ways in which enchantment, and the magical marketplace,
intertwines with other parts of the capitalist superstructure is
subject to specific historical contexts. It is sometimes
impacted by other historical agents such as lawmakers, which for
instance caused a shift from prediction to psychology in early
twentieth-century astrology; and it sometimes absorbs or fuses with other
economic activities in ways that <a href="../roundtable-2022-02-24">Davies structured in three categories</a>. Bramen&rsquo;s example shows how modern-day astrology
has suffused Wall Street, online venture capitalism and the lifestyle
economy, perhaps especially since the crisis of 2008 when the flaws in
capitalist structures and economic theory became more widely visible.
Going forward, it therefore bears thinking about how and why certain
forms of enchantment were sometimes included in the economic &lsquo;sphere&rsquo;,
and sometimes excluded from it.</p>
