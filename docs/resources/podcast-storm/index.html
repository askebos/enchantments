<p>Welcome fans and followers of Enchantment in the History of Capitalism,
a young research network that wants to, I guess, conceptualize
enchantment in ways that deepen our understanding of the history of
capitalism. So do check us out on
<a href="http://www.economic-enchantments.net">www.economic-enchantments.net</a>,
where you can find shared resources and reports of previous events as
well as announcements of exciting upcoming events. And if you do check
out our website, you will notice that our guest of this latest podcast
episode has been involved with our network before, and rightly so.</p>
<p>Jason Josephson Storm is professor of religion and chair of Science and
Technology Studies at Williams College, Massachusetts. Uh,
Massachusetts. It's always a word that I dread saying out loud. A
historian and philosopher of the human sciences, Jason has worked and is
working still &ndash; and I think quite tirelessly, if I have some kind of
idea of how busy you are &ndash; to decentre dominant narratives in the study
of religion and science especially. And one myth that he has laid bare
in a book, which is, by the way, essential reading in our network&rsquo;s
bibliography is that of disenchantment as a rupture, I think, between
the premodern and modern world. Is that fair to say? And most recently,
in 2021, Jason&rsquo;s book <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo90478773.html"><em>Metamodernism:</em> <em>the Future of Theory</em></a>
articulated new methods of knowledge production in the humanities and
the social sciences. So Jason, hi, thank you so much for doing this.</p>
<h5 id="000136-jason">00:01:36 Jason</h5>
<p>Hello, and it's a pleasure to be here. It's great to talk to you. I
just came off of two hours of other meetings, so my voice may be a
little bit hoarse, but please forgive that. This is really exciting and
it's, but it's great to be able to chat with you about all this stuff,
which I'm so passionate about, yeah. And especially the economic
history side of it is something that it I've been just learning so much
by listening to other conversations about this, whereas the enchantment
stuff I've been tarrying with for, for quite a while, let's &ndash; so
yeah.</p>
<h5 id="000205-kristof">00:02:05 Kristof</h5>
<p>I'm happy to hear that, because I am aware that you've been talking
about this book for &ndash; I think it came out 2017, I think, so you've
been talking about it for five years now, so I'm hoping my questions
won't be the same questions that you've been answering for the past
five years. But even so, perhaps by means of introduction, and maybe
it's an impossible question: what is enchantment to you? And what is it
that drew you to wanting to pick at that myth of disenchantment, as you
called it?</p>
<h5 id="000234-jason">00:02:34 Jason</h5>
<p>Yeah, well, let's&hellip; I'll answer those two questions in reverse in a
certain way. So, I think the thing that drew me to the topic of the
question of the myth of disenchantment from the beginning was &ndash;
actually, it happened when I was doing various kinds of field work
outside the United States. Actually, I was doing field work in Japan,
and I kept hearing versions of the narrative that, you know, East Asia
was enchanted and that the West was a place that was fundamentally
disenchanted. And this, you know, seemed to reinforce various
orientalized binaries that folks like Edward Said have written so
eloquently in criticism of. And it also seemed to me to be deeply
problematic and didn't fit my own experiential evidence. For example,
my grandmother, Felicitas Goodman, was a fairly famous anthropologist
who at a certain point in her life &ndash; the phrase that people use was
&lsquo;went native&rsquo;, but in any case came to believe in the reality of
spirits. And I knew that she wasn't very alone in that pattern. I had,
you know &ndash; meeting with her friends, many of whom were well-respected
academics and anthropologists, even &ndash; a lot of people in the so-called
heartland of Disenchantment, the United States and also Europe, Western
Europe and North America, actually did believe in spirits, in ghosts.
Some of them even believed in things that they called magic.</p>
<p>And so it seemed hard to me to hold apart, and much more problematic, to
suspend this kind of abyssal line between a West that was disenchanted
and a South or an East that was somehow a wealth springs of enchantment.
And so I begin to ask this question: How do we get the idea that the
West was disenchanted, and then the further wrinkle of that, as I tried
to do historiographical research, is that that myth, that narrative of
the West as a place that it had this unique modern rupture really came
to dominance in the nineteenth century, in a period in which most
historians had noted the importance of spiritualism, Theosophy and
occult revivals. So it was really, it became a double puzzle. Like why,
against the backdrop of this range of phenomena, had Europe &ndash; Western
Europe &ndash; and North America come to think of itself as uniquely rational
or uniquely demythologized or uniquely absent in belief in the very
things that historians now think were proliferating. And so, yeah, so I
guess only in that. Well, that's one cut across your question, let's
say.</p>
<h5 id="000509-kristof">00:05:09 Kristof</h5>
<p>And the way I read your book, it's very much an intellectual history.
You could say it's about the theorists of this disenchantment myth. And
I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about who produces
those myths? And who consumes them in a way? Because you talk a lot
about the social and the human sciences, I think, about the genealogy of
this myth that originated in intellectual circles. But it's a myth that
I think caught on very quickly in wider culture &ndash; precisely in the
places where social and human scientists go to look for the subjects
that they study.</p>
<h5 id="000542-jason">00:05:42 Jason</h5>
<p>Yeah, I mean it's a really&hellip; So doing archival research is really fun,
and there are two discoveries.</p>
<p>There are two ways to sort of frame this. The first is that the
narrative, one version of a narrative of disenchantment, s was actually
incredibly widespread in folkloric milieus in the European historical
context and alongside the trope of magic itself. So already since
Chaucer's, you know, for instance <em>Canterbury Tales</em> but you know we
could argue all the way back to, you know, Plutarch or something like
that, there were narratives of the departure of, you know, people used
to believe in spirits, or the gods used to be present, but now they're
gone. Or the fairies used to be present but they had made their
farewell, and many a book of magic began itself with an account of magic
departure, or at least scarcity.</p>
<p>So, you know, and there are some good examples that I referenced in the
book, and I can find other citational sources if you'd like. But
basically, often, you know, a spell book will say, you know, this is the
lost recovery of the wisdom of Moses, or you know of Solomon, or, you
know, or something or another that otherwise, you know, has been unseen
in the world. So in this respect an idea that magic was scarce or
elsewhere or vanished was a common trope in folkloric circles in the
European context already.</p>
<p>Some part of the very definition of the notion of magic had a kind of
&lsquo;archaicism&rsquo; often built into it, or at least an &rsquo;elsewhereness&rsquo; built
into it. We might trace this etymologically with the term <em>magos</em> as a
term, for instance for Persian, let's say, ritual specialists that was
used as an exoticizing term in the original Greek context.</p>
<p>So in the one case there were already these folklore tropes, but that
wasn't quite the myth of disenchantment itself. In order to describe
European history and culture with a kind of authority, scientific
authority, or social scientific authority, and to describe it in terms
of where that second piece, the recovery piece, was missing, that took
something important, you know, not only was magic gone, but it wasn't
&ndash; this wasn't a secret attempt to smuggle in the magic. That took a
very concrete form, I want to argue that it first starts appearing in
significant formulations at the beginning of the nineteenth century in
German philosophical circles. It appears in the writings of a range of
different folk in a circle in and around Hegel, for instance. But I
focus in on Friedrich Schiller and his notion of an &rsquo;entgöttete Natur&rsquo;
or de-godded nature as a significant &ndash; which appears in his famous poem
the gods of Greece, where he starts to describe what is a kind of
narrative about Christianization.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to talk a little quickly, but I know we don't have an
Infinity of time. Also, I get it. I talk to quickly when I get excited.
Deep breath. But Schiller imagined a nature stripped of its wonder if
its animating forces as a side effect of both the ascent of a kind of
what we would now call science, and as a part of a direct result of a
Christianization process. So he was interested in how, you know, nature
lost its gods in a way, or its animating forces, but it took a long time
before that became a kind of a truism in ethnographic field work or in
sociological theory, or what have you. One key figure &ndash; I&rsquo;ll name two
key figures there. The one that is likely to be less familiar today,
although more influential in his own epoch, was J. G. Frazer, the
important Scottish folklorist, classicist turned folklorist, who, in
many respects, lifted some of the tropes from the folkloric milieu. He
read about tropes like the fairy farewell, the idea that the fairies had
been present but they were gone, and he referenced them. I found doing
some archival work at Cambridge &ndash; I found, you know, clippings that he
had made of passages where those were repeated. And he also developed an
idea of a set of stages in which human history had gone through, where
there was an age of magic and an age of religion, and then an age of
science.</p>
<p>And so for him, there was this trajectory that he thought all historical
civilizations should ideally go through. And then he was particularly
worried about Britain or Great Britain or perhaps specifically Ireland&rsquo;s
failure to go through that and the lingering &lsquo;superstitions&rsquo; that he
described as, like, ready to burst forth. And he was thinking things
like spiritualism in particular, but also fairy belief. So there was
already that tension in his formulation.</p>
<p>And then the second important figure that I would lift up now&hellip; I talk
about many more in the book, but the one I think it's important to
emphasize is the German sociologist Max Weber, whose formulation of the
phrase &lsquo;die Entzauberung der Welt&rsquo; or the disenchantment, or literally
the disenchanting of the world, gave this notion of the loss of magic a
really portable formulation, a really easy shorthand to describe what
was seen as this particular process which Weber thought of as central to
the history of &ndash; European history, basically, Western history
stretching all the way back to the Hebrew prophets. He said, you know,
that there was a product of a certain kind of rationalization process.</p>
<p>But it is here that, and I know that some of the other guests in your
program have gesture back to Weber, there are a lot of misunderstandings
about Weber in particular, because there's a standard reading of Weber
that comes from only reading this public talk, basically, that he gave
to a bunch of students, the &lsquo;Sciences Vocation&rsquo; lecture, and kind of
riffing on that as if that's the canonical formulation of that phrase,
as if that tells us everything Weber meant.</p>
<p>And unfortunately for later scholars and historians, Weber was in many
respects extemporizing or talking in poetic language that was unusual
for the otherwise super dry sociologists and it wasn't his most serious
and concise formulation of what he meant by either the disenchanting of
the world, or by magic or by rationalization. You know, he talked &ndash;
there are a lot of gestures in that text that he doesn't repeat in more
serious formulations. Rather, he wanted to argue and I've done this
both in the book <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo26032843.html"><em>The Myth of Disenchantment</em></a>, but also I ended up
condensing it and making it even more pointed in an article or in a book
chapter &lsquo;Max Weber and the Rationalization of Magic&rsquo;, where I kind of
spell out the implications of my intervention a little more specifically
than I did in my book chapter.</p>
<p>The thing is, a lot of scholars of Weber have mistakenly assumed that
rationalization and magic were opposed. That magic is the opposite of
rationalization. And you know, there are reasons that you might get that
if you only read or primarily just read that lecture of his and maybe
the few scattered remarks in <em>The Protestant Ethic</em>, etc. That's not
what Weber had in mind, as is clear in his writings, for example on
interpretive sociology and what have you, he talks about how magic
itself is instrumentally rational. He's very clear about that. Magic
has a purpose to it. It's for, especially in his mind, primitive
peoples. It's totally rational for them to believe in magic, and magic
is instrumental for them and so in that respect, it's not an opposite
of rationalization. And indeed, in his famous <em>Economy and Society</em> text
that was edited, et cetera, as a, you know, a big culminating text of
his, even describes &ndash; or he thinks of East Asia as a place that
underwent a systematic rationalization toward magic. Rather than
disenchantment, it developed a rationalized set of enchanted beliefs,
and he's thinking particularly in that context about Chinese forms of
divination, particularly <em>huli jing</em> practices, but also what we could
call <em>feng shui</em> and also Chinese medicine basically. So, in that
respect, magic and rationalization are not opposites. Magic can itself
be rationalized into something that he thinks of, at least in the
Chinese context, as a kind of magic sphere.</p>
<p>And then also the other key point is that when he's describing the
disenchantment of the world or the disenchanting of the world, he
doesn't think that magic is gone or that even people stop believing in
it. If you read him carefully, he's interested in how a category of
magic is created and then demonized. And so, as he puts it pretty
clearly, the Puritans, for example, who are key figures for him in &lsquo;die
Entzauberung der Welt&rsquo;, had witchcraft trials, and if anything, he knows
that they proliferated. And so, and he knows that they continue to
believe in, you know, spirits and magic, even as they render those
demonic.</p>
<p>So for him, what the disenchantment of the world meant was not a world
stripped of magic, but a world in which magic is increasingly either
demonized or located within its own sphere. It becomes demarcated and
separated and distinguished from things like religion, or like science,
or like what have you. And so anyway, so that's an intervention that I
make for Weber scholars.</p>
<h5 id="001417-kristof">00:14:17 Kristof</h5>
<p>Can I just quickly jump in there and ask if &ndash; you know, myths usually
have some kind of purpose. So is that one of the purposes of the myth of
disenchantment to, and I think you mentioned it in the round table as
well a few months ago: you took, you mentioned Sudhir Alladi
Venkatesh's term, the &lsquo;underground economy&rsquo;. Is that one of the
purposes of the myth or is there no such intentionality? You know, the
dislocation of this magical marketplace into margins and into
criminality or illegality.</p>
<h5 id="001446-jason">00:14:46 Jason</h5>
<p>I mean, I think that's one product of what's happened by the
demarcation of a sphere and calling it magic. It then tended to, you
know, if we look at the trajectory of, let's say, European history
from, you know, the eighteenth century to the present, increasingly
so-called &lsquo;magical services&rsquo; have been, or certain sets of practices are
pushed into the underground economy. Those that aren't monopolized by
other sectors of society &ndash; medical professions or clerical professions,
etc. &ndash; tend to then be pushed and located that way. I don't think
that's&hellip; But I want to be careful about purpose versus consequence. So
I want to suggest that on the one hand European thinkers did begin to
demonize magic as part of a long history of Christian anti-paganism, so
that's one of the things that's going on.</p>
<p>But also, you know, demonize a category of practices that they called
magic. Or, you know, some of that happened in Protestant and Catholic
confessional struggles, where in and around the Reformation, Protestant
thinkers accused all kinds of ritual practices of being magical, or many
kinds of them being magical. And Catholic thinkers, a part of the
Counter Reformation then wanted to demarcate themselves off from folk
practices that they had previously been basically OK with and that, you
know, so there became a new kind of renewed &lsquo;anti-paganism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This also happens in a moment where elite culture is demarcating a
sphere of, you know, practices that have been previously labeled as
either witchcraft or natural magic, and redefining them as science in
part to cause themselves to escape persecution for things like alchemy,
et cetera. And so there, you know, there are a bunch of different forces
at stake. And I'm talking even concretely, you know, thinkers like
Francis Bacon, who are, you know, so famous for formulating what's
called the scientific method, who himself described what he was doing
and points as the science of magic. And he took this term &lsquo;magic&rsquo; and he
was trying to render it, you know, de-esoteric, basically, and make it
amenable to experimental evidence, et cetera, but so a lot of that
struggle happens at a particular moment and we can look at those
effects.</p>
<p>Now the myth of disenchantment, insofar as it's a sociological or
anthropological myth, I think it has a different kind of function. I
think part of it is a way that European thinkers had come to think of
the uniqueness of the West and it served both by proponents and critics
of what was seen as the West uniqueness. So on the one hand people like
Frazer who were in effect boosters for, you know, European colonization
projects, basically, who thought that, you know, wanted to extend
Enlightenment to the globe; the West&rsquo;s disenchantment or at least its
transition from religion to magic to science was something that
everybody should emulate. It gave the European project special
authority.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were critics of that. There were people &ndash; I
read Weber as a much more melancholy thinker, for instance, who is
conflicted, at least, about the departure of belief in, you know,
magical belief or belief in sort of the specialness of things. And,
well, he often equates magic and charisma together, and so, not always
&ndash; sometimes &ndash; he distinguishes them, but in a few famous places he
glosses them as the same term. And I think he was, in a way, melancholy
of how a certain kind of scientific rationality had rendered the world
less special in certain ways, and it demonized certain kinds of beliefs
and practices.</p>
<p>And then that very myth, sociological myth, often animated contemporary
enchantment projects because it's not just academics who read other
academics. It's a little bit like that, but there are exceptions. And
things like Frazer's <em>Golden Bough</em>, which was where he articulated his
mission of disenchantment, was, for example, a very famous source when
Aleister Crowley was formulating his magical revival. He, again, he
said, oh, look, here's the, you know, anthropological, folkloric
evidence that magic is gone. But let me look through this and use it as
an inspiration for spells so that I can then use it to revive magic. So
in that respect the myth of disenchantment has in a certain sense been
self-refuting: the more you talk about magic being absent.</p>
<p>There's another piece here in my particular version of this model,
which is I want to say that it partially emerges from presuming that
science and religion are autonomous and separate spheres. And so the
other key sort of landmark moment in the formulation of a myth of
disenchantment is the moment in the, basically, early, well mid 19th
century European context where discourse around science and religion as
two things that are in conflict begins to emerge. I see it around
figures like Draper's famous book <em>The Conflict Between Religion and
Science</em>, their fights in, you know, German natural sciences a little
bit earlier and other fights a little bit later, in France. But in
effect once you have the idea that there's a conflict between religion
and science, it becomes tempting to solve that conflict by finding
places where they overlap. And it makes the place where they overlap
particularly fraught. So a lot of people who, like Aleister Crowley,
were promoting what they thought of as religious sciences or, you know,
occult sciences, which are often the places where religion and science
were seen as overlapping &ndash; that's part of why I do, you know, Religion
and Science and Technology Studies &ndash; it's been one of my interesting
preoccupations all along, because there are different ways to approach
those overlapping spheres.</p>
<p>Or, you know, discursively people arguing that they're, you know, we
either need to differentiate them more and they're in conflict, or
arguing that they have discovered a new way of, like, fixing the problem
between religion and science. Another key example for that is the
Theosophical Society and Madam Blavatsky, who argued for a kind of
science of religion that was supposed to research what she saw as a
conflict originating between Christianity and science, perhaps. And
although, you know, she had her own anti-Darwinism and some other
complications in her particular wrinkle.</p>
<p>So all that is to say, once you have these two spheres held in tension,
it's often tempting to produce a third sphere. And that third sphere is
often demarcated as the superstitious or if you're more positive toward
it, the magical, and therefore it's a place to be recouped. But it's
also a place to be policed.</p>
<p>I guess the other piece of it that I would add is that academics &ndash;
there&hellip; It's not a linear trajectory. Academic disciplines seem to
then often look outside of themselves for different kinds of resources,
and then sometimes police themselves anew. So for example, we might
think of the history of telepathy in anthropology. Margaret Mead, for
example, was a proponent of telepathy. And then it gets purged again. Or
I was just reading some contemporary anthropologist on the history of a
folkloric account of bears and he was like &ndash; there's a weird
reference. It's interesting reference to telepathy in that text. Maybe
it's coming back again, I don't know. But anyway, you know, like the
beliefs go up and down in patterns. What gets defined as magical or
superstitious and then policed out of various academic disciplines, you
know.</p>
<p>And all that said, if you look at the sociological evidence on belief in
America and Western Europe, if you look at surveys of people who say
that they believe in, let's say, spirits or magic or witchcraft, etc.,
the percentages are quite high. I reviewed different kinds of
sociological evidence in <em>The Myth of Disenchantment</em>. And viewers are
welcome to consult it there. But based on how you define it, something
like 73% of Americans hold some kind of &ndash; the person doing the survey
called it paranormal, that's not my preferred term &ndash; but about 73% of
Americans hold some kind of paranormal belief, and it's probably the
case that academics hold a lower percentage of them. Or are more likely
to be skeptical. But even so, it's not the case that as sort of broad,
generalizing sociology, these beliefs have not vanished They've changed
and they've evolved or, you know, shifted in significant ways over the
span of the last, you know, any unit of time you're interested in, but
these beliefs haven't vanished, and so for that reason there's also a
tendency for them to seep back in, perhaps into academic context as well
as others. So, yeah, I guess that's one, you know, when one cut across
the material, yeah.</p>
<h5 id="002218-kristof">00:22:18 Kristof</h5>
<p>That's a very helpful summary of the whole book, almost, I think. But
also just maybe as a final question, I was just wondering about this
myth as an intellectual construct. It became a vernacular myth at some
point, and I was wondering because at some point I think you mentioned
somewhere that capitalism has the capacity to &ndash; I can't remember
exactly how you said it, but it absorbs or integrates all magic. And I
was wondering if one extent, you know, the enchanted fields or I don't
know how to call it &ndash; the underground economy, in a way, has itself
absorbed the myth of disenchantment to present itself as modern in a way
or as, you know, thriving in in current capitalist structures.</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean, two ways I could put this, but it's a great question. So
in the first instance, you know, there was a longstanding
historiographical tradition that imagined that capitalism itself was
fundamentally disenchanting. Basically, like, as countries got &ndash;
capitalism was allied with a kind of rationality, at least an ends-means
rationality, that the process of quantification was opposed to notions
of qualification and value and therefore, you know, everything gets
turned into numbers.</p>
<p>That was a theory. Now that clearly hasn't happened, right? Like,
capitalism didn't make people more rational, at least, not in that
respect. I mean, you know, people now are more quick to put a price
sticker on something or whatever, but in that notion&hellip;</p>
<p>So instead, what happened? What seems to have happened is that various
things that are demarcated as enchantments are heavily commodified. And
so what you tend to get is, you know, you can go to Walmart and get, you
know, smudge, you know, materials for smudges and magical crystals. You
can get on eBay and ask people to perform spells for you. That's
apparently a lucrative, or at least for a while was a lucrative field on
eBay. So you know. But capitalism also, even if it were opposed to
capitalism, even if enchantment and capitalism were opposed systems,
capitalism has the capacity to commodify its own opposition. So, for
instance, you know, like you can also get at Walmart like, you know,
shirts that have Che Guevara on them, you know, I mean, or like, you
know, you can buy the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> on, you know, eBay or, you
know, whatever.</p>
<p>So capitalism has already had the capacity to already assimilate its
putative opposites. So this shouldn't surprise us. What's interesting
is the way that exactly a lot of internal practices tend to emerge in
the underground economy. So there's been some great work, for example,
on the role of fortune telling among African-American women in urban
areas as something that &ndash; because there's not, you know, these are
professions that people can get into without, you know, rigorous
training or any kind of particular formal schooling and then they seem
to fill needs that people have in the community.</p>
<p>The other piece that we could add, I could add, riffing on capitalism is
that capitalism, one of the other features of capitalism is its
unpredictability like any, you know, hedge fund manager will tell, you
know, will have to admit if you push on it &ndash; or a serious economist &ndash;
capitalism has fluctuations in it.</p>
<p>And in that respect, that very unpredictability of capitalism has often
contributed to people wanting various kinds of spiritual or supernatural
forecasting. And so, there's also a long history of seers or you know
for the market, prophets of the market. And then we can see as
capitalism globalizes and enters the other parts of, let's say the
Global South &ndash; there's been some great field work on, for instance,
and I think of Birgit Meier's work but here in Africa where&hellip; and also
the Comaroffs work also on this geography as well. But basically, you
know, capitalism can enter a new area and then it changes economic
standing. It upsets older hierarchies. People suddenly get wealthy for
reasons that seem unpredictable. And for those reasons, too, often
people turn to a language of magic or witchcraft to try and explain the
unpredictability built into the system of capitalism itself. So I mean,
those are just some of the many ways in which capitalism and
&ldquo;enchantment&rdquo; have historically intersected, not the least of which
there &ndash; yeah.</p>
<p>There's also then a vast literature when we were talking about the
economic dimension of this, the commodification of the myth of
disenchantment itself. So then, of course, you &ndash; I also have books both
written for popular and academic audiences that tend to describe the
West in particular terms. And so you have, you know, or modernity in
particular terms. Sometimes these are aspirational texts that are being
marketed to, you know, people: &lsquo;We should be more modern&rsquo;, for instance.
And especially in the late 19th and early 20th century there were a lot
of, you know, texts that were pushing various times of modernization
projects. You know: &lsquo;Why France needs to become more modern&rsquo; or
whatever, &lsquo;The people are too &ldquo;superstitious&rdquo;&rsquo;, et cetera, et cetera.
And sometimes that was marketed to popular audiences: &lsquo;Look at how
backward the French peasants are.&rsquo; Assume a lot of things I'm saying
are in quotes here, are suspended, so there's that. But there's also,
you know, you can flip open contemporary new age materials that often
begin describing the &lsquo;West&rsquo; as stripped of enchantment. And then, of
course, then they go back to this older folkloric trope there then
aiming to resupply what they're describing is missing and there's a
strong, you know, history of advertising. Part of how advertising works
is sometimes is it encourages you or inculcates in you a sense of
absence or loss or need, in order to then provide itself as the solution
to that need, you know. Like, you know, if you think about your elbows
&ndash; the example that I often use when I'm talking to students about, you
know, like if you can convince people they have rough elbows, you can
sell them rough elbow cream, right? Like if you look at your elbows
enough, you'll probably be convinced of your rough elbows, right? So
partially convinces you that you have a need and then provides it, or
the cream is the solution to that need.</p>
<p>So in certain respects, the myth of disenchantment itself is kind of
like, oh look, you have rough elbows. Whether it's often because you
know it can be described in terms of melancholy or loss.</p>
<p>And in that sense one of my home disciplines, that of critical theory,
and even the way I got into this project in another way is through my
profound admiration for the work of Adorno and Horkheimer, in particular
<em>The Dialect of Enlightenment</em>, which was the main book that I'm
responding to in <em>The Myth of Disenchantment</em>. So <em>The Dialectic of
Enlightenment</em> in a certain respect begins or has as part of its
narrative a melancholy disenchantment narrative. It it's one of the
main places that we might say a left Weberism kind of lingers on in its
melancholy aspect. And so in that respect, critical theory functions as
advertising for re-enchantment narratives. And you can see this, you
know concretely, you know, in the whole spectrum of works, that a
so-called new animism or new vitalism or new materialism, many of which
take as their starting premises texts and critical theory which have
described disenchantment &ndash; either Weber, but more often by second or
third order and, you know, texts. But then the proposed solution is not
literally magical practices, but often supposed to be scholarly
reorientations that will allow one to see the world as vibrant, et
cetera, et cetera, in some new way. Anyway, so that's at least another
intersection, Because I always want to remind my interlocutors and
listeners that we academics, as much as we like to position ourselves as
outside the capitalist market and in certain ways as we're buffered
from it, can still get caught up in it, yeah.</p>

<p>I think that's a quite an important point to end on, especially moving
forward with the network as well. So I think&hellip; I'm quite conscious of
the time, so I'll have to cut it off here. But it's very lovely to
talk to you, Jason.</p>
<h5 id="003018-jason">00:30:18 Jason</h5>
<p>Yeah, it was a pleasure to talk to you as well. Thank you.</p>
<h5 id="003020-kristof">00:30:20 Kristof</h5>
<p>Have to do more of this soon. Thank you.</p>
