<p>Welcome, everyone, to an episode of the summer podcast of the Research Network Enchantment in the History of Capitalism. We&rsquo;re a very interdisciplinary group of scholars that get together to explore the different ways enchantment can be a methodological tool, conceptual structure, or a driving force one way or other in histories of capitalism and in the past month. With ‘we’ I mostly mean Astrid Van den Bossche and Anat Rosenberg.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve organized several roundtables in which we discussed the usefulness of enchantment in its many different definitions, it&rsquo;s a term that&rsquo;s often used in very evanescent ways, maybe very vague ways. And these podcasts are meant to build on that momentum, which is why I&rsquo;m very excited to welcome Will Pooley today.
Will is a Senior Lecturer in modern history at the University of Bristol, he tackles enchantment head on, I would say by studying primarily witchcraft, magic and the occult.</p>
<p>His first book, <em>Body and Tradition in Nineteenth-Century France</em>, used folklore sources to write a social and cultural history of the Moorlands of Gascony. And last months or the publication of a Cambridge element mini graph I think is the right term on creative histories of witchcraft written by Will Poppy Corbett and Anna Kiss B Compton, which I highly recommend. And it also doesn&rsquo;t stop there, where it&rsquo;s currently writing a book on witchcraft in Post Revolution France.</p>
<p>So welcome, Will. Hi.</p>
