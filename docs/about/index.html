  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>We’re a network of scholars who seek to develop enchantment as an organizing theme in historical studies of capitalism. We hope to provide a platform for those interested in the historical role of enchantment as a tool, structure, or foundation for the organisation and the development of modern markets, economic institutions, and economic relationships.</p>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>From February to May 2022, we ran a series of <a href="/resources"><strong>roundtables</strong></a> to converge discussion around a set of leading texts that represent existing conceptual and historical scholarship on enchantment in modernity, from the fields of theology, anthropology, the history of science, literature and art, philosophy, marketing and business.</p>
<p>The goal was to map existing knowledge as well as draw out theoretical points of contention through joint readings and discussion of a set of questions relevant for the history of capitalism. For example, we explored:</p>
<ul>
<li>What constitutes enchantment in theories of modern religion, of magic, or of other belief systems or ontologies?</li>
<li>Is enchantment theorized and investigated as a structural or as an individual phenomenon?</li>
<li>Is enchantment described as a continuous phenomenon (ongoing enchantment), as a new phenomenon (re-enchantment that followed disenchantment), or as historically-specific constellations that change across time and space?</li>
<li>Is enchantment conceptualized as manipulation or as a form of agency?</li>
<li>Is materiality fundamental to enchantment?</li>
</ul>
<p>During the summer and fall of 2022, we also recorded conversations with scholars on enchantment about their work. These conversations are available as <a href="/resources"><strong>podcasts</strong></a> and transcripts.</p>
<p>We are also holding <strong>work-in-progress</strong> meetings with 10-15 minute presentations, followed by a discussion. Meetings are held on selected Thursdays or Fridays. Check our <a href="/events">events</a> page for upcoming meetings, or, if you would like to participate, <a href="/events/cfp_work_in_progress">get in touch</a> with a title, an abstract, a brief bio, your time zone, and preferred dates.</p>
<p>Finally, we are planning a <strong>conference</strong> that will be held on 30 June and/or 1 July. We are currently exploring funding options that will determine the location. A Call for Papers with a deadline in February 2023 will follow. Save the date!</p>
